Programming Language: Python

Solution 1: Brute Force

Code:

for i in range(len(nums)-1): # i stands for the first index
            for j in xrange(i+1, len(nums)): # j stands for the second index
                if (nums[i]+nums[j]) == target: # if we find the index that sum up to target
                    return [i, j] #return the index

Solution 2: Hash Table(Dictionary in Python)

Code:

database = {} #dictionary
        
        for index, value in enumerate(nums): # first element of enumerate is index, second element is value
            remaining = target - value # ramaining is the value we are currently looking for
            if remaining in database:
                return [database[remaining], index]
            database[value] = index
        return []
